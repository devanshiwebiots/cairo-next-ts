          <li>One of the reasons why Bootstrap is so popular among web developers and web designers is that it has a simple file structure. Its files are compiled for easy access, and it only requires basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to modify them.</li>
          <li>You can also use themes for popular content management systems as learning tools. For example, most WordPress themes were developed using Bootstrap, which any beginner web developer can access.</li>
          <li>To increase the sites page load time, Bootstrap minifies the CSS and JavaScript files. Additionally, Bootstrap maintains consistency across the syntax between websites and developers, which is ideal for team-based projects.</li>
